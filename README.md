This report presents a thorough examination and design proposal for the HVAC system designated for 

the Mechanical Hall at MUST. The focus is on achieving optimal indoor environmental conditions 

through rooftop installation and ducted chilled air supply. Detailed calculations of sensible and latent heat 

loads form the basis for the selection of HVAC components, including the Chiller, Air Handling Unit, 

Pumps, and Fans. Manufacturer details and technical specifications are meticulously outlined. The report 

further provides a visual representation of the HVAC system layout. Monthly variations in electricity 

consumption and associated costs are graphically presented, offering insights into operational efficiency. 

An environmental impact analysis, measured in tCO2 emissions, is conducted for different months, with 

corresponding graphical illustrations. Through this holistic approach, the report aims to provide actionable 

insights for the implementation of an efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally conscious HVAC 

solution tailored to the unique needs of the Mechanical Hall
